# What?

> [M]y intention in writing this paper (other than simply to organize my findings for later reference) is to demonstrate an example utility function that I believe provides a relatively accurate model of a human beings ability to study efficiently in the short run, which I will assume to be a single continuous study session. After which, I will show how such a function could be used to maximize overall utility, which is, as I will go on to show, analogous to maximizing overall productivity.


# Why?

> I have been able to find several existing attempts to provide mathematical representations for long run utility models of studying. Additionally, I have found several examples of short run utility models being approached experimentally (e.g. "vigilance decrement" research, though not specific to studying, approaches a very similar model), but I could not find any attempts to derive a general formula from these results. Thus, in my opinion there seems to be a small section of this research area that may have been left neglected. Namely, few attempts seem to have been made to provide a mathematical representation for a short run utility model of studying. Such a representation, if accurate, could potentially be used to optimize a student's study sessions, thus making them more efficient. 


# How?
You will have to refer to my paper for this one, which has been uploaded to this repository and can be found [here](UtilityFunctionForStudying.pdf).


# Disclaimer
This paper is still in its beginning stages of life. As such, I remain rather skeptical of the claims it makes as well as the corresponding research that led to such claims.

Furthermore, it is not my intention to present this paper as though I have any authority on the matter whatsoever. The topic this paper explores is of personal interest to me, but I do not claim to be an expert in economics or cognitive theory. This paper is a conjecture based solely on the introspection of my own experiences and should be treated as such.

# TODO List

- [ ] Add bibliography and cite sources

### Methods and Results
- [ ] Clarify what assumptions this model makes about cognitive capital

### Discussion Topics
- [ ] What does this model suggest about the Pomodoro Method?
- [ ] How can we generalize this model in order to apply it to our other day-to-day activities? How does this generalization suggest we should go about maximizing our satisfaction throughout life?

### Concluding Remarks
- [ ] Explain how u(t) seems to be inherently limited by the fact that it can only successfully model scenarios where tmax=1.0
