# What?

#### Officially
> My intention in writing this paper (other than simply to organize my findings for later reference) is to demonstrate an example utility function that I believe provides a relatively accurate model of a human beings ability to study efficiently in the short run, which I will assume to be a single continuous study session. After which, I will show how such a function could be used to maximize overall utility, which is, as I will go on to show, analogous to maximizing overall productivity.

#### Unofficially
This project's existence is essentially just the result of a failed google search.

While researching this topic, I was able to find a fair amount of utility models for studying in the long run (a few of which I intend to cite in this paper), but I was unable to find any for the short run. Failing to find the answers I was looking for, I decided to do my own exploration on the topic.

It is not my intention to present this paper as though I have any authority on the matter whatsoever. The topic this paper explores is of personal interest to me, but I do not claim to be an expert in economics or cognitive theory. This paper is a conjecture based solely on the introspection of my own experiences, and should be treated as such.


# Why?

> Such a model, if accurate, would not only provide an illustration of the phenomena of diminishing returns and its effects on our day-to-day lives but would also serve as a testament to the relevance of utility theory in cognitive research. This model may also enable us to better understand and further validate focus and productivity software that is already in heavy use (e.g. the Pomodoro Method). 


# How?
You will have to refer to my paper for this one, which has been uploaded to this repository and can be found [here](UtilityFunctionForStudying.pdf).

Please keep in mind that this paper is still a work in progress.

# TODO List

- [ ] Add bibliography and cite sources

### Methods and Results
- [ ] Clarify what assumptions this model makes about cognitive capital

### Discussion Topics
- [ ] What does this model suggest about the Pomodoro Method?
- [ ] How can we generalize this model in order to apply it to our other day-to-day activities? How does this generalization suggest we should go about maximizing our satisfaction throughout life?

### Concluding Remarks
- [ ] Explain how u(t) seems to be inherently limited by the fact that it can only successfully model scenarios where tmax=1.0
